## About this Code

This code implements an Arduino based roaster controller for ESP32 series boards, tested with Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero and Espressif ESP32C6-devkitC both connected to a Skywalker v1 roaster.  This is NOT for v2 Skywalker.

Originally this code base was a spike to implement PID control on an older codebase (thus the name "QuickSV"), but it evolved into a refactor of the entire Skywalker v1 esp32 codebase and that code is what is shown here.
